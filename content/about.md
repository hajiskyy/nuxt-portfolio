# About me

![personal-image](/photo.jpeg){.max-w-52}

Iâ€™m a Web Product Developer who loves to bring product ideas to life. I craft beautiful and performant Web Applications with Javascript, Typescript, Nuxt, Vue.js, and more. My experience building web products has honed my skills and made me truly confident in my abilities to take on new challenges.

When I'm not coding, you can find me playing FIFA or dominating lobbies in Call of Duty. _Wanna link up? my PS tag is_ _**hajisky\_**_

Let's build something extraordinary together. I'm eager to bring my experience to your projects!
